Demo of machine learning using Linear Regression

The application use a data set of taxi trips in New York city containing 1000 rows of data such distance, pickup time, paid fare etc.
The ML linear regression model has been then trained on the data set using Databricks and the resulting model is deployed on Databricks with a REST api.

The second part of the demo is a user interface in the form of a web page that predicts the fare for a trip using the machine learning model through the REST api.
